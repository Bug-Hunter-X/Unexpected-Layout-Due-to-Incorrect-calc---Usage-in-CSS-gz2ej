The issue arises because `calc()`'s result needs to be correctly interpreted within the context of the layout model. In a flexbox container, the available space is calculated differently than in a normal flow layout. To fix this, ensure the `calc()` function's result is used appropriately within the flexbox context. Sometimes restructuring the layout or using alternative approaches is necessary to make `calc()` work as intended.  Consider the proper unit usage and order of operations within the `calc()` expression to avoid unexpected behavior.
